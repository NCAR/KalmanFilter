# KalmanFilter

This repository contains three main components:  

1. The text and code that led to an NCAR Technical Note describing the Kalman-Filter
processor developed for the research aircraft at the NCAR/EOL/RAF.  

2. A KalmanFilter.R script that produces Kalman-filter-corrected variables including
attitude angles and wind for specified netCDF-archived files.  

3. A Shiny app that provides a convenient way of running the processor and
viewing the results.
